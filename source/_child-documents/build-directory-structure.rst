Build/document/format or build/format/ ?
----------------------------------------

You might need a different build directory structure to mine. I created mine based on a single document – a user guide – for free and premium editions of the same product.

If you’re creating documentation for multiple products, you might create your directory structure more like this:

``Build directory > Product1 directory > Guide1 directory > Format1 directory``

Or, if you’re producing multiple documents for the one product – especially if those documents will be merged into a knowledge base – you might create your directory structure like this:

``Build directory > Format1 directory``

Build directory changes are easier to implement than source directory changes, so don’t worry if you’re not certain right now which structure you’ll need – it will quickly become evident!

.. pull-quote:: Your build directory structure will depend on the number of products, manuals, and formats that you need to produce.
