Child Documents directory
=========================

This is where you store the majority of your documents for your reStructuredText project. You don't have to do it this way - you can store all documents in the main manual directory (in this project, named **doc-kramers-rst-tutorial**) instead. The down side to this is if you later decide to produce another manual that uses some of the same subdocuments - you end up with a mess that takes effort and time to clean up.
