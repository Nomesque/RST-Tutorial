Images directory
================

This is where you store your images - diagrams, screenshots, and the like. You don't have to do this, but it makes for a neater project if you do.

It's named _images because Sphinx uses underscores to identify directories that contain resources, rather than the key project files like the index and configuration. Again, you don't have to follow this protocol. I do it because I find it easier to differentiate resource and project directories.
