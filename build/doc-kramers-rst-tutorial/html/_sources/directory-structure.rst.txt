Directory Structure
===================

Before getting into the meat of a project and writing the documents, I recommend having a serious think about your directory structure.

Why does it matter?
-------------------

The source directory structure that you choose will end up embedded in a lot of documents. That includes configuration files and every single internal hyperlink created. It’s possible to go back through and change things later, but it’s also a pain in the neck.

Basic project file structure
----------------------------

Each Sphinx documentation project needs the following directories and files:

* **Source directory** – contains all the source material, arranged in directories, for a project.
* **Master file** (by default, called index.rst) – this is the backbone of a manual that links to all the top-level documents.
* **Configuration file** (conf.py) – provides information for the build script on how to create various end formats for a manual.
* **Images directory** – contains all screenshots, diagrams, etc used in the project. If you’re incorporating video and audio files into your doco, this could be a media directory instead, or you could add video and audio directories.
* **Templates directory** – standard Sphinx directory that contains files it needs to build various end formats for a manual.
* **Base documents** – think of these as your ‘Heading 1’ documents that you’d want displayed in a basic one-level table of contents.
* **Child documents** – every other document that might be shared between multiple manuals, or multiple versions of the same manual.
* **Build directory** – this is where your end product manuals will be saved.

Your project’s directory structure will end up looking something like this:

Subdirectories of Source are Child documents directory, Document1 directory, Images directory, and Templates directory. In Document1 directory are index.rst, conf.py, and Base files. Subdirectory of Build directory is Document1 directory. Subdirectories of Document1 are Format1 directory and Format2 directory.

You’ll need an master file for every manual that you’ll create, and a conf.py file for every format that you create. Unless you have a huge number of manuals to produce, I suggest you create a conf.py file for every manual. That makes for a simpler build process.
