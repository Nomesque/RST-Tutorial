.. Doc Kramer's RST and Sphinx Tutorial documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Wed Aug  7 14:35:45 2019.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.
   You'll note that there aren't currently any files listed. That's because
   I haven't yet created any base documents - that comes with the next 
   tutorial. 
   This commented section (from the two dots onwards) doesn't appear in the final
   built document. That's because the two dots tell Sphinx that the contents are 
   a command or comment, not content that should be added to the build. As long as I
   indent three spaces and don't add a blank line, this is all treated as part of
   the same block.
   Each entry below (eg. 'planning') corresponds to a base document located in the 
   same directory as this master file.
